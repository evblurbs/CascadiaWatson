# Cascadia Watson

This is an application that shows an emoji that represents the current mood at the CascadiaFest conference. The mood is determined by using Twitter to get the latest tweets, and IBM Watson to do lingustic analysis.

This application was built in two hours during a hackathon at [CascadiaFest 2016](http://2016.cascadiafest.org/) by Robby King and Evan Johnson.

## Running the server

    $ node watson-server.js
